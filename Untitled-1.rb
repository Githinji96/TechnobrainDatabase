The query does the following:
1.It counts the total number of tasks in the database using COUNT(*) and aliases it as total_tasks.

2.It sums the task_completed column to count the number of completed tasks and aliases it as completed_tasks.

3.It groups the results by the task_assignee column to count the number of tasks assigned to each unique user, and aliases this count as tasks_assigned

The result set will include three columns: total_tasks, completed_tasks, and task_assignee, showing the total number of tasks, the number of completed tasks, and the number of tasks assigned to each unique user, respectively.

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_tasks,
    SUM(task_completed) AS completed_tasks,
    task_assignee,
    COUNT(*) AS tasks_assigned
FROM
    tasks
GROUP BY
    task_assignee;
